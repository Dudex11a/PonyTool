Pony Tool is a suite of tools I made for the Little Pony Tales art group to help them moderate the group. Some tools include random generation of creatures with different traits and random selection of items within the group. It was hosted on Netlify and uses serverless functions.

It can be found hosted [here](https://ponytool.netlify.app/).
